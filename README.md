# Portfolio Website Clone

## 📄 Project Overview
This project is a **clone** of an existing portfolio website, created as part of a group web development assignment.  
We recreated the original website using only **HTML** and **CSS**, with optional use of **Bootstrap** for layout and responsiveness, following the week's covered technologies.

## 👨‍💻 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)
- Google Fonts
- FontAwesome Icons

## 🛠️ Approach
- We first analyzed the original website structure and layout.
- We divided the tasks among the group members (section by section).
- We used a mobile-first approach to ensure the website is fully responsive.
- The code is clean, semantic, and well-commented for easier understanding.
- External resources like Bootstrap and FontAwesome were linked via CDN for simplicity.
- We tested the website on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
## 📂 Project Structure

## 📝 Features
- Responsive navigation bar with toggle menu.
- Hero section with a headline and CTA buttons.
- About section with profile image and biography details.
- Social media links.
- Smooth scrolling and responsive layout using Bootstrap classes.

## 📈 Challenges and Solutions
- Matching the original design closely: Solved by inspecting the source and using correct Bootstrap classes.
- Responsiveness: Solved by using Bootstrap grid system and media queries.

## 📢 Important Notes
- No JavaScript frameworks or libraries were used, except Bootstrap and external libraries like FontAwesome.
- All code is properly commented and structured.
- Each group member participated actively in the project.
